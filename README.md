# Frog-Game

## Puzzle:
The puzzle involves seven rocks and six frogs. The seven rocks are laid out
in a horizontal line and numbered left to right. The six frogs are evenly divided into a
green trio and a brown trio. The green frogs sit on Rocks 1, 2, and 3, facing right. The
brown frogs sit on Rocks 5, 6, and 7, facing left. Rock 4 is vacant. The challenge is to transpose the trios, jumping the green frogs to Rocks 5, 6, and 7 and
the brown frogs to Rocks 1, 2, and 3. Their movement is restricted. A frog can only
jump forward, either hopping to a vacant rock one place ahead (cost =1) or leaping over
its neighbor frog to a vacant rock two places ahead (cost = 2).
